Course description
------------------

"Visualizing Data" is an intensive five day workshop where participants practice the trade of data visualization. Visualization will be taught as a *design process*: In order to design effective visualization one needs to have a clear communication purpose in mind, know the audience, know a wide range of visualization idioms, be fluent in the tools required to transform imagination into a finished product, and be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization. This broad range of skills requires the integration of theory and practice. Participants will learn about visualization theory, including human perception, marks and channels, the visualization design process, and best practices. They will create their own visualizations given a question and a dataset, recreate, criticize and improve upon existing visualizations, and -- supported by the group and the lecturer -- work on their own visualization project.

Upon completion of the course the participants will:

  - understand visualization as a design process (as opposed to a set of techniques)
  - formulate a question and design an effective visualization to answer it
  - be able to rapidly explore a dataset using iterative visualization

Participants learn the technical skills to:

  - use `R` in conjunction with `ggplot2`, `dplyr` and `tidyr` to create a wide range of static visualizations
  - produce multi-layered maps and perform basic geocomputation using the `sf` package
  - be able to produce interactive visualizations with R and Shiny (a web-application framework for R)

- Day 4: Interaction and animation
- Day 5: Publication ready graphs & Project presentation

Course prerequisites
--------------------

In their application for the course participants *need to propose a visualization project* which can be finished over the course of the week. I suggest to produce an explanatory graphic for a particular data set and topic.

Participants need to bring a laptop with the latest available versions of R (cran.r-project.org), and Inkscape (inkscape.org) installed on it.

Participants must have basic experience in using R (loading data, installing and loading packages, indexing vectors, data.frames and matrices).

Examination
-----------

Participants pass the course if they finish the visualization project outlined in their proposal.

General Readings
----------------

The seminal source for the course is:

- [Munzner, T. 2014. Visualization Analysis and Design. CRC Press.](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/) This textbook is both comprehensive and approachable. It introduces visualization as a task driven design process as opposed to a set of ready-made techniques and teaches the knowledge necessary to design effective visualizations.
