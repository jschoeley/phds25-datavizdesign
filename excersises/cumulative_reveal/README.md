# Cumulative reveal

Create a presentation where you cumulatively reveal elements of a visualization. The cumulative reveal should match your commentary â€“ you reveal in the sequence you narrate the plot.

Below you find an example of how this task can be done.

One way to edit your figure is to export it as svg or pdf and to open it in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). You can open the complete plot and build it in "reverse", by taking elements away.
